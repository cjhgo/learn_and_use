% These slides also contain speaker notes. You can print just the slides,
% just the notes, or both, depending on the setting below. Comment out the want
% you want.

%\setbeameroption{hide notes} % Only slides
%\setbeameroption{show only notes} % Only notes
\setbeameroption{show notes on second screen=right} % Both

% To give a presentation with the Skim reader (http://skim-app.sourceforge.net) on OSX so
% that you see the notes on your laptop and the slides on the projector, do the following:
% 
% 1. Generate just the presentation (hide notes) and save to slides.pdf
% 2. Generate onlt the notes (show only nodes) and save to notes.pdf
% 3. With Skim open both slides.pdf and notes.pdf
% 4. Click on slides.pdf to bring it to front.
% 5. In Skim, under "View -> Presentation Option -> Synhcronized Noted Document"
%    select notes.pdf.
% 6. Now as you move around in slides.pdf the notes.pdf file will follow you.
% 7. Arrange windows so that notes.pdf is in full screen mode on your laptop
%    and slides.pdf is in presentation mode on the projector.

% Give a slight yellow tint to the notes page
